      <p class="intro-paragraph left-hand">Welcome to my portfolio website. I started coding little bits and bobs a few
        years ago but
        only recently started learning properly about code and web development. <br><br>I am currently working through
        the
        Codecademy FullStack Dev course. Here are some projects I have been working on.</p>

        <p class="project-text">My eldest daughter loves unicorns so when I asked asked to make a business landing page
          I decided to take inspiration from her.
          Her and her sister added some of their own content.<br><br>
          Two elements of the design that I focused on involved using media queries to make the nav responsive and the
          meet the team flexboxes switch at breakpoints.</p>

        <p class="project-text">The brief was make something fun and Christmas themed for the local Codebar
          Christmas
          Competition.<br><br>
          I based this project around the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas", creating a calculator for the number
          of
          presents received each day and in total.<br><br>
          In hindsight it was quite an ambitious project so early in my coding journey but I sought help where
          needed,
          building and rebuilding to ensure I understood each part of the code I was using.</p>
